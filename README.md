# Obstacle Avoidance Robot 

![Obstacle Avoidance Robot](robot_image.jpg)


## Description

This project is a Raspberry Pi-based obstacle avoidance robot that uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in its path and a motor driver to control its movements. The robot is designed to autonomously navigate and avoid obstacles in real-time.

## Features

- Obstacle detection using an ultrasonic sensor
- Autonomous obstacle avoidance
- Motor control for movement
- Real-time distance measurement and path correction
- Customizable behavior and parameters

## Hardware Components

- Raspberry Pi (Model 3 or higher)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 or similar)
- L293D IC
- DC Motors and Wheels
- Resistor (1k) and Capacitor (100nF)
- Connecting wires and Bread Board
- Chassis and frame for the robot
- Battery or power source


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obstacle-avoidance-robot.git


2. Start the robot by running the main script:
   
      ```bash
       python robot.py
